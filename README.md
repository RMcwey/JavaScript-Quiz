# JavaScript-Quiz
### 1.Description: 
This is a fully functional JavaScript quiz. Upon loading the page, the user is presented with the option to start the quiz or check the leaderboard from their local storage. Upon starting the quiz, the user is presented with a question and 4 multiple choice answers to choose from. When they select an answer, if it is correct, they are presented with a "Correct!", no time is deducted, the correct answer turns green and they are able to press the next button when ready.

When the user presses the wrong answer button, they are penalized 15 seconds off the timer and "Incorrect" is also shown to them. The wrong buttons turn red also. The leaderboard does pull from local storage and has a functioning clear and submit button that will log the last score receieved from the test. There is also a player to play Fugue #2 from Bach if the user would like.
